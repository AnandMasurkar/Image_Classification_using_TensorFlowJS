# Image classification using pretrained MobileNet (using only javascript)

## Project Description
The purpose of this project to develop a web app which will be used to classify images using pretrained MobileNet model.
Entire process from image selection to performing machine learning in browser(using TensorFlow.js library) along with classification 
results is performed on client side.

## Project Execution screenshots
<b>Step 1</b>

Home page of website where users have access to two buttons
1. select image 
2. Predict 

By default pretrained Mobile net model is selected. (By performing minor changes in current code it can easily 
be modified to select different model)

Selected image section will display user selected image from their local machine

Results will be displayed at the bottom after user has clicked predict button.
